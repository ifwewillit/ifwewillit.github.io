                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>A major enterprise client required a third-party penetration test before signing. We'd never had one. Our security posture was decent but undocumented. We had good practices in place but couldn't prove it. The gap between "we're secure" and "we can demonstrate security" was about to cost us a significant deal.</p>

                <h2>Constraints</h2>
                <ul class="constraints-list">
                    <li><strong>Tight timeline.</strong> Client needed results before quarter end. No time for perfect.</li>
                    <li><strong>No security team.</strong> Engineering was busy shipping product. This landed on me.</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation gap.</strong> Practices existed but weren't written down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unknown unknowns.</strong> We didn't know what the pen testers would find. That's the point.</li>

                <h2>What I Built</h2>

                <h3>Scoping</h3>
                <p>Worked with the pen test firm to define scope. Which systems, which attack vectors, what's in bounds. Coordinated with engineering to identify all external-facing services, APIs, and data flows. You can't test what you haven't mapped.</p>

                <h3>Pre-Assessment Hardening</h3>
                <p>Before the test, addressed the obvious gaps. Unused ports closed, default credentials rotated, unnecessary services disabled. Not to hide problems, but to focus the test on real attack surfaces instead of low-hanging fruit.</p>

                <h3>Access Control Audit</h3>
                <p>Full review of who had access to what. Discovered several accounts that should have been deprovisioned, permissions that had crept beyond role requirements, and service accounts with excessive privileges. Fixed all of it.</p>

                <h3>Documentation</h3>
                <p>Created security documentation that didn't exist: network diagrams, data flow maps, access control matrices, incident response procedures. Not for compliance theater, but because you can't secure what you can't describe.</p>

                <h3>Remediation Process</h3>
                <p>When findings came back, triaged by severity and exploitability. Critical issues fixed within 48 hours. Created tracking system for remediation progress. Coordinated retesting to verify fixes.</p>
