                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>NOMAD was growing fast. When I joined, we had 12 people and no IT infrastructure. Laptops were purchased ad hoc. There was no SSO, no device management, no access governance. Every new hire meant manual account creation across a dozen tools. Every offboarding was a liability waiting to happen.</p>
                <p>The company was scaling to enterprise clients who would ask hard questions about our security posture. We needed to look like a company that took this seriously, because we were becoming one.</p>

                <h2>Constraints</h2>
                <ul class="constraints-list">
                    <li><strong>No dedicated IT budget.</strong> Everything came from general operations, justified line by line.</li>
                    <li><strong>No IT team.</strong> I was it. Every system needed to be maintainable by one person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed over perfection.</strong> We were hiring faster than I could build. Good enough now beat perfect later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enterprise requirements incoming.</strong> Clients were starting to send security questionnaires. We needed answers.</li>

            </section>

                <h2>What I Built</h2>

                <h3>Identity & Access</h3>
                <p>Google Workspace as the identity provider, with SSO enforced across every tool that supported it. SAML where possible, OAuth where not. The goal: one place to provision, one place to deprovision, audit trail everywhere.</p>

                <h3>Device Management</h3>
                <p>Standardized on MacBooks with Kandji for MDM. Automated enrollment, security baselines pushed on first boot, software deployment without touching the machine. New hire gets laptop, laptop configures itself.</p>

                <h3>Vendor Ecosystem</h3>
                <p>Built relationships with 70+ vendors. Consolidated where possible, integrated where it mattered. Created a vendor database tracking contract terms, renewal dates, SSO status, and data processing agreements. Nothing falls through the cracks because I can see all of it.</p>

                <h3>Access Governance</h3>
                <p>Role-based access templates in a spreadsheet (yes, really). When someone joins as a Sales rep, I know exactly which 15 tools they need. When they leave, I know exactly what to revoke. The system is simple because simple systems actually get followed.</p>

                <h3>Documentation</h3>
                <p>Every process documented in Notion. Not just what to do, but why. New IT person could take over tomorrow and understand the reasoning behind every decision.</p>
