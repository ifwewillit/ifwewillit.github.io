        <div class="container article-content">
            <p>I've built three functions from nothing at NOMAD: IT, People Operations, and AI capability. Each time, the starting point was the same: no systems, no documentation, no precedent. Just a growing company and a gap that needed filling.</p>

            <p>Here's the pattern that emerged.</p>

            <h2>Start with the Pain</h2>

            <p>Don't start with best practices or what other companies do. Start with what's breaking. Where are things falling through the cracks? What questions keep coming up that no one can answer? What's taking too long?</p>

            <p>When I started building IT at NOMAD, the pain was clear: every new hire meant hours of manual account creation. Every offboarding was a security risk. People couldn't find the tools they needed. Start there.</p>

            <h2>Document Before You Build</h2>

            <p>Write down what exists before you change anything. Not because it's good, but because you need to understand the current state. What tools are in use? Who has access to what? What are the actual workflows, not the theoretical ones?</p>

            <p>This documentation becomes your baseline. When you make changes, you can point to what was and what is. It also surfaces dependencies you didn't know about.</p>

            <h2>Solve the Next Problem, Not All Problems</h2>

            <p>The temptation is to build the complete system upfront. Don't. Solve the most urgent problem, document the solution, and move on. You'll learn things from the first solution that will change how you approach the second.</p>

            <p>I built NOMAD's SSO implementation before I built device management. I built device management before I built the vendor tracking system. Each one informed the next.</p>

            <h2>Build to Hand Off</h2>

            <p>Every system should include documentation detailed enough for someone else to run it. This isn't about you leaving. It's about you not being a bottleneck. Functions that depend on one person's memory aren't functions.</p>

            <p>The test: could someone with no context take over this system tomorrow and keep it running? If not, you haven't finished building it.</p>

            <h2>Measure Something</h2>

            <p>Pick one or two metrics that tell you if the function is working. Not vanity metrics, but real indicators. For IT, I tracked time-to-productivity for new hires and access review completion rates. For People Ops, I tracked time-to-fill and offer acceptance rates.</p>

            <p>You don't need a dashboard. You need to know if things are getting better or worse.</p>

            <h2>The Pattern Repeats</h2>

            <p>I've now done this three times. The domain changes but the approach doesn't. Find the pain. Document the current state. Solve one problem at a time. Build for handoff. Measure something real.</p>

            <p>That's it. No framework, no methodology. Just the same questions asked again and again until a function exists where there wasn't one before.</p>
