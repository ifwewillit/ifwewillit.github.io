                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>Looking for my next role. I'm interested in director and executive positions at companies where operations is a competitive advantage, not overhead. Ideal fit: 50-200 person company, technical product, leadership team that values systems thinking.</p>
                <p>Specifically interested in roles that span People, IT, and Operations. I've done that combination for four years and I'm convinced the lines between them are artificial at most company sizes.</p>

            <section class="now-section">
                <h2>Learning</h2>
                <p>Deep into machine learning fundamentals. Not to become an ML engineer, but to be dangerous enough to spec projects, evaluate vendors, and ask the right questions. Currently working through Stanford's CS229 materials and building small projects to internalize concepts.</p>
                <p>Also studying compensation design more formally. The gap between "we have salary bands" and "we have a compensation philosophy that drives behavior" is larger than most companies realize.</p>

            <section class="now-section">
                <h2>Building</h2>
                <p>This site. Built by hand, no templates, no frameworks. HTML and CSS like it's 2005, except the CSS is better now. The constraint forces clarity. Every element earns its place or gets cut.</p>
                <p>Also maintaining the systems I built at NOMAD through the transition. Good infrastructure should outlast the person who built it, and I'm making sure it does.</p>

            <section class="now-section">
                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>Working on a series of dishes around winter citrus. Blood oranges, Meyer lemons, kumquats. The challenge is balancing brightness against richness when everything else on the plate wants to be heavy.</p>
                <p>Still refining my approach to mole. Three versions in the last month. None quite right yet. Getting closer.</p>
