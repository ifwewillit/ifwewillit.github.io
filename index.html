                    <p class="lead">Four years scaling a high-growth proptech from startup to Inc. 5000. Built three functions from zero. SHRM-CP certified. Technical enough to write the code, strategic enough to know when not to.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently Head of IT, People Operations & Strategic Enablement at NOMAD, reporting directly to the COO. When I arrived, there was no IT function, no People Operations, no AI capability. Now there are documented systems, scalable processes, and $275K+ in annual ROI from infrastructure I designed and deployed.</p>

                    <p>Before that, I co-founded a property management company and spent five years coordinating wilderness expeditions at Colorado Outward Bound School. I've managed operations in remote backcountry with no cell service and in high-growth startups with too much Slack. The fundamentals are the same: build systems that work when you're not watching.</p>

                        <h3>How I Cook</h3>
                        <p>I'm a story-driven, place-based chef. I don't cook to impress with tricks. I cook to say something true about where I've been and who I am now. Every dish has to earn its place. If it doesn't say something, it doesn't belong on the plate.</p>

                        <p>I lead with savory flavors. Depth matters more than sweetness. I use heat on purpose: smoke, char, bitterness, and fat are tools, not effects. My food is minimalist but not delicate. Clean plates, strong flavors. I remove more than I add.</p>

                    <ul class="influences">
                        <li><strong>American Southwest</strong> — chiles, smoke, restraint</li>
                        <li><strong>New Zealand</strong> — honesty, simplicity, letting protein speak</li>
                        <li><strong>Pine Ridge</strong> — respect for scarcity, resilience</li>
                        <li><strong>Colorado</strong> — contrast, altitude, clean finishes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Flavor Biases</h3>
                    <p>Umami, bitterness, smoke, acidity. Food that has weight and tension. Little patience for trend chasing or sauces that exist just to exist.</p>

            <div class="kitchen-connection">
                <p>The kitchen taught me systems thinking. A good kitchen doesn't rely on cooks remembering orders. Ticket comes in, stays on the rail until food goes out. The system makes status obvious. I run organizations the same way.</p>
