                <h2>The Background</h2>
                <p>I paid for college working as a chef. Line cook, prep cook, eventually running kitchens. The discipline transferred: build systems that don't depend on heroics. Document everything. Remove what doesn't earn its place.</p>

                <p>In 2024, I was selected as a semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation's home cooking award. The entry was a dry-aged duck with stone fruit mostarda, black rice, and charred brassicas. Three months of development for one plate. Fourteen attempts at the mostarda alone.</p>

                <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I cook from the Sonoran desert tradition I grew up with, filtered through years of professional technique. Chiles, citrus, smoke. Clean flavors, honest ingredients, nothing on the plate that doesn't belong there.</p>

                <p>Same principle applies to my professional work. Clarity over complexity. Systems that scale. Nothing that's just there to look impressive.</p>

                    <h3>Restraint is a choice</h3>
                    <p>The hardest decision is what to leave off the plate. Every element should earn its place. If it's just decoration, cut it.</p>

                    <h3>Document everything</h3>
                    <p>Recipes are systems. Write them down well enough that someone else could execute them. That's how you improve.</p>
