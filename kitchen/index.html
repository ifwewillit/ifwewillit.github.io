                <p>I grew up outside. Hiking, mountaineering, long days where preparation mattered and shortcuts showed up fast. Being in the outdoors teaches you early that some things are non-negotiable. You plan, you respect conditions, and you don't fake competence.</p>
                
                <p>That mindset stuck.</p>
                
                <p>I'm drawn to things done properly. Craft over convenience. Fewer decisions, made well. If something is worth doing, it's worth doing right. Otherwise, don't do it at all.</p>
                
                <p>I have a deep appreciation for the finer things in life, not as status symbols, but as proof of care. Well-made tools. Thoughtful design. Food, architecture, systems, experiences that show intention. Quality is visible when you know what to look for.</p>
                
                <p>I care about clarity. About removing noise until only what matters remains. I don't chase trends. I refine fundamentals. Whether I'm building something, cooking, traveling, or solving a problem, the goal is the same: make it durable, understandable, and honest.</p>
                
                <p>The outdoors still grounds me. Mountains, water, quiet spaces where scale resets perspective. They remind you that you are small, time is long, and most things aren't worth rushing.</p>
                
                <p>I cook because it's one of many places these principles show up. Not because it defines me, but because it rewards discipline and attention. The same standards apply everywhere else.</p>
                
                <p>This site is where my personal interests live. Ideas, projects, observations. No branding. No performance. Just the things I care about and the standards I try to live by.</p>

                <p>I paid for college working as a chef. The discipline transferred: build systems that don't depend on heroics. Document everything. Remove what doesn't earn its place.</p>
                
                <p>I cook from the Sonoran desert tradition I grew up with, filtered through years of professional technique. Chiles, citrus, smoke. Clean flavors, honest ingredients, nothing on the plate that doesn't belong there.</p>
